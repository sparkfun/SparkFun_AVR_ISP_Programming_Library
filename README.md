# SparkFun AVR ISP Programming Library

We wrote this library to help with configuring the ATtiny processors on our products during production testing. We've made it public just in case you find it useful too.

This library can be installed via the Arduino Library manager. Search for **SparkFun AVR ISP**.

Some of the content is based on Nick Gammon's [arduino_sketches](https://github.com/nickgammon/arduino_sketches), predominantly [Atmega_Hex_Uploader](https://github.com/nickgammon/arduino_sketches/tree/master/Atmega_Hex_Uploader). Thank you Nick.
